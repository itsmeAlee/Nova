# Git & Version Control

1. **Conventional Commits**:
   - `feat:` for new features (e.g., `feat: add shopping cart context`).
   - `fix:` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix: correct stock calculation logic`).
   - `ui:` for design changes (e.g., `ui: update expiry badge color`).
   - `chore:` for config/maintenance.

2. **Commit Frequency**:
   - Commit often. Small, atomic commits are better than one massive commit.
